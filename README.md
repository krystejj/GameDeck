# GameDeck

GameDeck is a free and open-source desktop app that shows information about your games. It is written in Rust using Tauri, so it is cross-platform, you can run it on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Currently it is planned that GameDeck will support 3 games: VALORANT, League of Legends and Minecraft. Integration for more games is possible but is hard to create and maintain as one person.

Planned features are:
- for all games:
    - wiki
- for VALORANT and League of Legends:
    - ability to view store, match history and friends
    - notification when wished item is in store
    - recording matches with events and ability to replay them with timeline containing events
    - esport info
- for VALORANT:
    - better Discord presence
